## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work on outlining your purpose/audience/goal and Persona. You have enough detail included here to inform a design strategy for your project.

If your target market will be professional peers and mid-large size tech companies, your site's presentation, style, and content should be tailored for that audience. Flawless layout on mobile devices is a must, and the look and feel should be polished and professional.

There are many ways that you can illustrate your soft skills, tech skills and intelligence that's both informative and visually engaging. The use of iconography and color along with simple and clear text content can be a simple way to add visual impact and a professional "polish" that might be a nice highlight of front end skill. Engaging design can be as simple as using one or two colors, a nice font, high quality content, and some imagery. It's really all about balance and consistency. Many beautiful examples can be found just by google searching "_web developer portfolio_". [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is an great (and easy) way to incorporate iconography.

Your code looks pretty good overall, and your project has been set up correctly. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
 
### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- No need to place those `<ul>`s inside a `<p>` tag. I would avoid this going forward.
- Same with the `<h2>` tags... I would move those outside of the `<p>` tags.
